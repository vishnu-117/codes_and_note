Let's go through the graph-related problems one by one.

---

### 1. **Clone Graph**

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

#### Solution

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def clone_graph(node):
    old_to_new = {}

    def clone(node):
        if node in old_to_new:
            return old_to_new[node]
        copy = Node(node.val)
        old_to_new[node] = copy
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            copy.neighbors.append(clone(neighbor))
        return copy
    
    return clone(node) if node else None
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)
node1.neighbors = [node2, node4]
node2.neighbors = [node1, node3]
node3.neighbors = [node2, node4]
node4.neighbors = [node1, node3]

cloned_graph = clone_graph(node1)
```

**Output:**

Cloned graph with the same structure as the original.

### 2. **Course Schedule**

There are `n` courses labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisite[i] = [a_i, b_i]` means you must take course `b_i` before the course `a_i`. Determine if you can finish all courses.

#### Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def can_finish(num_courses, prerequisites):
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    indegree = [0] * num_courses

    for course, pre in prerequisites:
        adj_list[pre].append(course)
        indegree[course] += 1

    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if indegree[i] == 0])
    completed_courses = 0

    while queue:
        course = queue.popleft()
        completed_courses += 1
        for neighbor in adj_list[course]:
            indegree[neighbor] -= 1
            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return completed_courses == num_courses
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
num_courses = 2
prerequisites = [[1, 0]]

print(can_finish(num_courses, prerequisites))
```

**Output:**

```
True
```

### 3. **Pacific Atlantic Water Flow**

Given an `m x n` matrix of heights, find all coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.

#### Solution

```python
def pacific_atlantic(heights):
    if not heights: return []

    m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
    pacific, atlantic = set(), set()

    def dfs(r, c, visit, prev_height):
        if ((r, c) in visit or r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= m or c >= n or heights[r][c] < prev_height):
            return
        visit.add((r, c))
        dfs(r + 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
        dfs(r - 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
        dfs(r, c + 1, visit, heights[r][c])
        dfs(r, c - 1, visit, heights[r][c])

    for i in range(m):
        dfs(i, 0, pacific, heights[i][0])
        dfs(i, n - 1, atlantic, heights[i][n - 1])
    for j in range(n):
        dfs(0, j, pacific, heights[0][j])
        dfs(m - 1, j, atlantic, heights[m - 1][j])

    return list(pacific & atlantic)
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
heights = [
  [1, 2, 2, 3, 5],
  [3, 2, 3, 4, 4],
  [2, 4, 5, 3, 1],
  [6, 7, 1, 4, 5],
  [5, 1, 1, 2, 4]
]

print(pacific_atlantic(heights))
```

**Output:**

```
[(4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (1, 4), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (2, 2), (2, 1)]
```

### 4. **Number of Islands**

Given a 2D grid map of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

#### Solution

```python
def num_islands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    def dfs(grid, r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= len(grid) or c >= len(grid[0]) or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c)
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c)
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1)
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1)

    count = 0
    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                count += 1
                dfs(grid, r, c)
    return count
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]

print(num_islands(grid))
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

### 5. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

#### Solution

```python
def longest_consecutive(nums):
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest_streak = 0

    for num in num_set:
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_streak = 1

            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_streak += 1

            longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

    return longest_streak
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

print(longest_consecutive(nums))
```

**Output:**

```
4
```

### 6. **Alien Dictionary (Leetcode Premium)**

There is a new alien language which uses the English alphabet. The order of the characters is unknown. Given a list of words from the alien language, determine the order of characters.

#### Solution (Using Topological Sort)

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def alien_order(words):
    adj_list = defaultdict(set)
    in_degree = {char: 0 for word in words for char in word}

    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        first, second = words[i], words[i + 1]
        min_length = min(len(first), len(second))
        if len(first) > len(second) and first[:min_length] == second[:min_length]:
            return ""
        for j in range(min_length):
            if first[j] != second[j]:
                if second[j] not in adj_list[first[j]]:
                    adj_list[first[j]].add(second[j])
                    in_degree[second[j]] += 1
                break

    queue = deque([char for char in in_degree if in_degree[char] == 0])
    result = []

    while queue:
        char = queue.popleft()
        result.append(char)
        for neighbor in adj_list[char]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return "".join(result) if len(result) == len(in_degree) else ""
```

### 7. **Graph Valid Tree (Leetcode Premium)**

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges, determine if these edges can form a valid tree.

#### Solution

```python
def valid_tree(n, edges):
    if len(edges) != n - 1:
        return False

    parent = [-1] * n

    def find(v):
        if parent[v] == -1:
            return v
        return find(parent[v])

    def union(v1, v2):
        root1 = find(v1)
        root2 = find(v2)
        if root1 == root2:
            return False
        parent[root1] = root2
        return True

    for v1, v2 in edges:
        if not union(v1, v2):
            return False

    return True
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]

print(valid_tree(n, edges))
```

**Output:**

```
True
```

#### Solution

```python
def count_components(n, edges):
    parent = [-1] * n

    def find(v):
        if parent[v] == -1:
            return v
        return find(parent[v])

    def union(v1, v2):
        root1 = find(v1)
        root2 = find(v2)
        if root1 != root2:
            parent[root1] = root2

    for v1, v2 in edges:
        union(v1, v2)

    components = set(find(i) for i in range(n))
    return len(components)
```

#### Example:

**Input:**

```python
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

print(count_components(n, edges))
```

**Output:**

```
2
```
